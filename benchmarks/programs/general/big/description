Ping-pong benchmark. Sends messages back and forth between actors and
has a "sinkActor" which all actors reports to when they are done with
sending ping messages to other actors. 

The benchmark works in chunks of sizes at most 1999 as a result of a
drastic increase in memory usage in the Encore version if an actor was
"aware" (in form of references to those in its neighbor array) of more
than 2043 other actors.

Every actor sends 16 000 ping messages before terminating.

Execution: 
      <programName N> where N is the amount of actors to use in
      the benchmark.
