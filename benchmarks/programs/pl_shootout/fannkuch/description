The fannkuch benchmark
(http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=fannkuchredux)

The encore implementation comes in two forms, one built on actors
(fannkuch_redux.enc) and one built on tasks (fannkuch_foreach.enc).

Number of tasks is at the moment set to be at most 200, but feel free
to experiment with this value.

Execution: 
      <programName N> where N is the size of the original set
      ({1,2,...,N}) that the fannkuch algorithm is executed on.


Interesting observations: 
      fannkuch_redux.enc: 
      increasing the nChunks variable renders in higher CPU-usage 
      but in slower execution time.

Known issues:
      fannkuch_foreach.enc:
          might seg-fault, reason unknown.
