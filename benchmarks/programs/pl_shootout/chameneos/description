The chameneos benchmark:
(http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=chameneosredux)

Consists of C number of chameneos objects, all wanting to meet another
chameneos object in the mall (represented as an actor). All chameneos
will try to meet another chameneos in the mall and mutate (change its
colour) M amount of times.

Benchmarks the performance of a constrained system where one object
must handle a lot of requests from other objects.

Execution: 
Two alternative versions exists: 

Alt.1  <programName M C> where M is the amount of meetings that each chameneos 
       will execute and C is the amount of chameneos to be used in the benchmark.

Alt.2  <programName M> where M is the amount of meetings that each
       chameneos will execute. Runs the default version (one run with
       3 chameneos and one run with 10 chameneos before termination)
       found at
       http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=chameneosredux

Known issues: 
      The encore version of Alt.2 above will sometimes
      prematurely exit as described in
