Welcome to the Encore Compiler!
Here you will meet many wonderful methods and functions and whatnot!

To be able to compile an Encore program you will need to have a Main-class
with a main-method inside.
Lets try a simple "Hello World"!

For example:


```
active class Main

    def main() : unit
        println("hello world")
    end

end
```
