This error occurs when the compiler was unable to infer the concrete type of a
variable. It can occur for several cases, the most common of which is a
mismatch in the expected type that the compiler inferred for a variable's
initializing expression, and the actual type explicitly assigned to the
variable.

For example:

```
let x: int = "I am not a number!"
--     ~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--      |             |
--      |    initializing expression;
--      |    compiler infers type `String.String`
--      |
--    type `int` assigned to variable `x`
```
