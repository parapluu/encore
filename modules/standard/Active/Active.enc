module Active

-- This class wraps any object into an active object.
--
-- This class is useful to make passive implementations behave asynchronously,
-- like global counters and such.
class Active<inner> {
  state : inner

  -- Constructor
  --
  -- The constructor receives a factory that it will use to create an instance
  -- of the inner class. This factory must return a thread safe or unique object.
  def init(factory : () -> inner) : void {
    this.state = factory();
  }

  -- Apply a function to the state, asynchronously.
  --
  -- The function will be applied to the inner state at some time in the
  -- future.
  def apply(f : inner -> void) : void {
    f(this.state)
  }

  -- Apply a function to the state and replace the state with its
  -- result, asynchronously.
  --
  -- The function will be applied to the inner state at some time in the
  -- future.
  def map(f : inner -> inner) : void {
    this.state = f(this.state)
  }

  -- Retrieve the inner state, asynchronously.
  def getState() : inner {
    this.state
  }
