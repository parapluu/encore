# Encore Documentation

To learn more about Encore, visit [upscale-project](https://upscale.project.cwi.nl/)

The documentation is written using [Scribble](http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/),
which generates both html and pdf (with embedded math).

A prerequisite for building the documentation is obtaining [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) and ensuring that the racket bin directory is on your path. 

To generate the Encore documentation, type:

    $ make

This creates a `build` folder where you can find the documentation in html and pdf.
