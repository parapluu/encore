This is a literate encore program. It consists of a single code
block (shown below), this introduction, and a closing statement.

#+begin_src encore
class Main
  def main() : unit
    println("Hello literate world!")
  end
end
#+end_src encore

As you probably understand by now, compiling this file will only
compile the code above.
