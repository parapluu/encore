When writing literate programs in org-mode it is possible to give
flags to the code blocks in order to control how they should be
rendered etc. This file tests that this works.

#+begin_src encore -n
class Main
  def main() : unit
    new Foo
    println("Hello flagged literate world!")
  end
end
#+end_src encore

Here is some C code that should be ignored

#+begin_src C -n
  unit foo() {
    2+3;
  }
#+end_src

Here is an unspecified block that should be included

#+begin_src -n -i
class Foo
  -- "another Encore class"
end
#+end_src
