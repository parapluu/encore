This file contains multiple code blocks. A class starts with the
declaration of the class name:

#+begin_src encore
class Main
#+end_src encore

A method is defined using the "def" keyword followed by the method
name, its arguments in parenthesis, and a colon followed by its
return type:

#+begin_src encore
def main(args : [String]) : void
#+end_src encore

The method body follows directly after the header:

#+begin_src encore
print "Hello multi-block literate world!"
#+end_src encore
