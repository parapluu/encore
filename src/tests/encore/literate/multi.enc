This file contains multiple code blocks. A class starts with the
declaration of the class name:

#+begin_src encore
active class Main
#+end_src encore

A method is defined using the "def" keyword followed by the method
name, its arguments in parenthesis, and a colon followed by its
return type:

#+begin_src encore
  def main(args : [String]) : unit
#+end_src encore

The method body follows directly after the header:

#+begin_src encore
    println("Hello multi-block literate world!")
  end
end
#+end_src encore
