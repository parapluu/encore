#+literate

This literate program is meant to be imported by mixed.enc. The
first line of this file signals to the compiler that this file
should be read as a literate program. It is an alternative to
using the --literate flag that also works for imported modules.

#+begin_src encore
module Foo

fun foo() : unit
