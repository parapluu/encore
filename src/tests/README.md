# Tests

This directory contains all tests and the `test` script.

## Creating a Test

A test is a pair of an encore program, exactly one of three kinds of test
specification files, and an optional file detailing how to run the test:

### Specification files

A test specfication tells the framework what the test should do. It is a file in
the same directory, and with the same name as the test program file
(`testname.enc`), but a different file ending.

There are three kinds of specification files, two of which are supported right
now, and one of which may be supported in the future:

 - `testname.out` -- the most common test specification. It contains the exact
   output that is expected from running the program. In order for the test to
   pass, the program must compile, and the test return a zero value.
 
 - `testname.err` -- the second most common test specification. It contains the
   exact output that is expected from a failing program. In order for the test
   to pass, the program must compile, and the test should return a non-zero
   value.
 
 - `testname.fail` -- some tests ensure that the type checker does what it
   should. In these tests, `testname.fail` contains one regular expression per
   line that must appear in the compiler output. In order for the test to pass,
   the program must *fail* to compile.

 - `testname.flags` -- should contain any extra flags passed to encorec to
   compile the program *on a single line*. Extra flags for running the program
   is currently not supported.

 - `testname.chk` -- Currently not used/implemented.

### Running a Test With Input

Tests that need to be run in a special way (like with certain command line
flags) can optionally provide a file `testname.run` that must contain, on one
line, the command to run the test properly.

## Creating a Test Suite

Any directory under `src/tests` that contains tests is a test suite and will be
run by calling `./test` in this directory.

## Running Selected Test Suites

The `test` script can take either the name of a test (no `.enc` extension) or a
directory as a parameter. In the former case, it will run that test, in the
latter case, it will run all tests in that directory.

Example:

```
   .. $ ./test encore/modules # will only run the tests within encore/modules
```

## Disabling Tests and Other Ignored Files

To temporarily disable a test from running or to ignore any other
`.enc` files in the test directory hierarchy, 
add the tests names to the [IGNORED_FILES.grep](IGNORED_FILES.grep) file. Be careful not to
add any blank lines.

## Test output

You will get nicer output if you have the `tree` tool on your path.
