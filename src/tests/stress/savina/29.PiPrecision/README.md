## Precise Pi Computation

This code **compiles and runs**. However, I do not currently support arbitrary
signed decimals, so all decimal run with 128 bit precision (`long double`).

The file `PiPrecisionConfig.enc` contains configuration classes similar to
the original Scala implementation.

The file `PiPrecisionActorBenchmark` contains the `Main` class of the program.
